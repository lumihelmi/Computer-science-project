Target assessment level of this work is 2.

Specification:

The program
1. Asks for a random number from 1 to 10.
2. Reads the user's input and answers how commonly that number is given as an answer to the question according to statistics.
3. Asks the user to guess which colour I'm thinking of.
4. Reads the user's input and lets the user try again until they guess the correct colour.

Data format
The input data is read from the user. int userInput is a single integer between 1-10 and String colour is a single word.

Correctness and exception handling: 

Typical test case
When the program is run with user input (1, green, blue), this is the output:

Let's explore some probabilities.
Pick a random number from 1 to 10: 
1
Surprisingly, this is an uncommon answer (only ~3.4% of people pick it)
Now, try to guess which colour I'm thinking of. (Don't capitalize)
green
Good try. Guess again :D
blue
You're right, congratulations! This is the most common favourite colour.

Exception handling
The following are all the possible exceptions/special cases and the way they are handled.
- java.util.InputMismatchException if user inputs a non-integer answer to the first question (reported to user, program exits)
- Number is not within given range in the first question. (output: "Number is not within the range 1-10. Did you know that 0.5% of people answer zero when asked this question?"
- Other errors (reported to user, program exits)
